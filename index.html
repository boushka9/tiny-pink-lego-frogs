            <h1>Meet Emma</h1>
                <p>Emma Boushka is currently enrolled in a six-month Coding Bootcamp at the University of Texas at
                    Austin to become a full-stack web developer. She thrives in the fast paced and goal-oriented
                    environment of the bootcamp and values the opportunity to continuously learn and grow. </p>
                <p>Outside of Emma's academic performance where she maintained a 4.0 GPA throughout college, she has
                    work experience in a variety of roles that required her to be adaptive, analytic, and creative. Her
                    work as a research assistant and a tutor required her to develop unique teaching methods and work
                    effectively with groups with diverse needs and ablities. She is equipped to create
                    realistic goals and improvement plans. She is most proud of her time spent working for Diagnostic
                    Outpatient Imaging because of the opportunity she had to grow within the company as she took on new
                    roles and responsibilities. Because of this, she values the incredible impact that a communicative,
                    collaborative, and supportive team can have on the quality of work produced. </p>
                <p>In her free time, Emma loves to take her dog on walks, rollerblade, and build lego sets.
                    Besides her dog, her pride and joy is her Harry Potter Lego collection that she displays in her
                    home. </p>
